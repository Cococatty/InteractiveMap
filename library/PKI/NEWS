NEWS for PKI package

0.1-3	(under development)
    o	fixed crash when loading private keys introduced by PR#1
	in (unreleased) 0.1-2 and bring back the ability to directly
	read "DER"-encoded private RSA keys.

    o	fix detection of PKCS#8 encrypted private keys in PEM format


0.1-2	(not released)
    o	add "DER" format option to PKI.load.cert()

    o	allow key in PKI.verify to be a certificate
	(which will be passed to PKI.pubkey() internally)

    o	add experimental signing/verification of tar files using
	PKI.sign.tar() and PKI.verify.tar()

    o	add support for symmetric ciphers like AES in
	PKI.encrypt()/PKI.decrypt()

    o	add support for retrieving the subject of a certificate
	via PKI.get.subject() [PR#2, thanks to Matt Jones]

    o	add support for PKCS#8 private key format (RFC 5208)
	and sign/verify/digest using SHA256.
	[PR#1, thanks to Siddhartha Bagaria]

    o	bugfix: key length was incorrectly checked when using
	symmetric ciphers so too short keys were accepted.

    o	bugfix: if the last block was filled during encryption, the
	necessary additional padding block was not generated. (#8)

    o	bugfix: some functions did not call PKI initialization.
	One manifestation was that error messages were cryptic until
	any X.509 function was called. (#9)


0.1-1	2013-02-19
    o	added PKI.load.key() and PKI.save.key()
	functions to load/save keys from/to PEM and DER formats

	IMPORTANT API NOTE: PKI.load.key() replaces the
	(unexported) function PKI.load.privkey()
	in the previous PKI version.

    o	added support for OpenSSH public key format
	(as used in .ssh/authorized_keys files)
	as well as pure PKCS#1 and SSH2 PEMs

    o	make PEM parsing more robust to support
	headers

    o	added ASN.1 tools to parse and synthesize ASN.1
	formatted objects - mostly for use in key format
	conversions

    o	added as.BIGNUMint() for ASN.1 BIGNUM integer
	format conversion

    o	added PKI.mkRSApubkey() to create RSA public keys
	from modulus and exponent alone

    o	added raw2hex() function to convert raw hashes
	into string format


0.1-0	2012-11-05
    o	first public release
